<h1>High Level Design</h1>

<u><h2>Game and Achievements</h2></u>
<p>The Game and Achievements subsystem is designed using a modular, object-oriented architecture that enmphasizes scalability, maintainability, and event driven communication between modules. As shown in the figure 
  below the system is divided into four primary managable modules: Connector, Progression, Social, and Admin. Each of the modules are responsibile 
  for a direct set of functionality ranging from event registration and forming custom achievements for users, making a leaderboard to compare 
  with friends, and admin control to ensure small changes without having to write new code. Together, these modules collectivaly address all 
  the functional and non-functional requirements for the game and achievements layer of the Ai Academic Companion.</p>

<u><h2>AI Tutor</h2></u>
<h3>Component Overview</h3>
<p>
  The AI Tutor component exists under the ID <strong>HLD-201</strong>. The AI Academic Companion contains this 
  component which operates as its intelligent learning assistance subsystem. The system operates through large 
  language models and natural language processing technology. The system delivers individualized tutoring support 
  which adapts to specific situations. The component receives data from the scheduler and Canvas feeds.
</p>

<u><h2>Scheduler</h2></u>
<h3>Overall Design</h3>
<h3>Required Frameworks/External Libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>ChatGPT/Openai API:</b> This will be the LLM used to generate the schedules. </li>
  <li><b>Canvas: </b>This will be used to gather user's assignments, due dates, and events</li>
</ul>
<img src="assets/images/schedule_HLD.png" class="image">
<p><b>Data Integration Layer:</b> This will be used to gather prerequisite data to send to the AI companion to start the schedule generation process. The prerequisite date includes: assignments
  from the user's profile on Canvas (due dates and names), user's preferred gym hours, study hours, breaks, personal time, and any other extracurriculars that the user would like to be on 
  their schedule.
</p>
<p><b>Main Schedule Generation Layer:</b> This is where the schedule will be generated for a user. The AI Companion will have received data from the data integration layer, and will 
  create an effective and manageable schedule. Any edits from the frontend are then communicated back to the AI Companion that will update and change the schedule, which will then reflect back to the frontend.
</p>
<p><b>Database:</b> This is where the user's schedules will be stored. Previous schedules will be stored so that the AI Companion can refer to them and learn from any changes from the user. This way
  the AI Companion can create more effective schedules for its user.
</p>
<p><b>Frontend Layer:</b> The frontend layer will be displayed to the user. Specifically, it will show the calendar with the schedule that the AI Companion had created, and from there,
  the system will notiy users about upcoming due dates or any assignment changes. Moreover, the user is able to make edits to the schedule that will then be sent back to the AI Companion to 
  update the schedule.
</p>
<h3>Data Integration</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Classes:</b> API Data and User Data</li>
  <li>Responsibilities:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Grab data from 3rd party APIs (Canvas) to get user's classes, assignments, and due dates. (FR-402, NFR-407, NFR-408)</li>
    <li>Query the user for specific constraints they would like to have for the schedule. (FR-401, FR-403)</li>
    <li>Formatting and cleaning data for the AI Companion.</li>
    <li>Grabbing consent from the user to be able to use their sensitive student infromation. (NFR-409)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Main Schedule Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Classes:</b> AI Companion, User Edits, Schedule</li>
  <li>Responsibilities:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive data from the Data Integration Layer to query LLM to generate the user's schedule. (FR-404, NFR-401)</li>
    <li>Keep checking data from API Data to ensure the system is in synch with Canvas and the user's assignments and classes and make any necessary changes and updates to the user's schedule. (FR-405, NFR-402, NFR-403, NFR-411)</li>
    <li>Notify the user when any updates/changes to the schedule were made. (FR-407)</li>
    <li>Learning from any manual changes from the user and from previous schedules in the database. (NFR-410)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Database</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Responsibilities:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Store any edits that the user has made. (NFR-404, NFR-405)</li>
    <li>Store previous weeks' schedules. </li>
    <li>Keep a history of schedules so that the AI Companion can use them to learn and hone in on the user's preferences. (NFR-410) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Frontend Layer</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Classes:</b> User Edits, Calendar, Notification System, User Feedback</li>
  <li>Responsibilities:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the user is able to interact with the visual schedule to make any necessary changes. (FR-406, FR-412)</li>
    <li>Taking the schedule from the AI Companion and displaying it nicely to the user. (FR-411) </li>
    <li>Constantly notifying the user when any changes to the schedule have been made and synchronizations from Canvas.(FR-407) </li>
    <li>Notify the user for when the AI Companion recommends any new habits the user should adopt to keep the schedule. (FR-409) </li>
    <li>Any feedback the AI Companion requests will be presented here and any feedback will be send back to the AI Companion. (FR-408, FR-410) </li>
