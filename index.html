<h1>AI Academic Companion</h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As artifical intelligence (AI) improves, it is starting to change the way that students apply themselves in school. AI is starting to integrate into education where schools are starting
  to use AI as an educational tool. Not only that, but many students are starting to rely on AI to make informed decisions for them regarding their academic responsibilities and using 
  AI as a learning tool. Many modern educational applications, such as Canvas and Google Calendar, provide users with information they need at a glance, however require manual inputs from 
  their users. They are able to provide tools to create schedules and course management, however without any learning capabilites nor personalization for each of their users. We found that about
  75% of students procrastinate due to a lack of an organized schedule per week. Not only that, but students that do have a pre-scheduled week tend to have to spend a lot of their time 
  to construct said schedule when they could have put that time towards other tasks or assignments. To combat this issue, we propose an AI academic companion that will set out to integrate
  scheduling tools, academic tools, and personalized tutoring all in one platform. We propose the AI academic companion as an extension to Google or Hokie SPA to seamelessly interact with
  educational tools such as Canvas. The AI academic companion will take student information such as classes, assignments, and other school-related events and create a daily schedule for its
  users. Moreover, users will be able to input extracurricular activities to be included in their schedules. These can include work hours, personal hours, gym hours, etc. This way the AI academic
  companion will create an optimized schedule that balances school and personal time. Aside from schedule generation, the AI academic companion will also have the option to tutor its users during their study hours. The companion will use natural language processing
    to read from the students' Canvas classes to deliver explanations, examples, and quizzes based on their contents. The AI academic companion will also feature a game system where
    the student will be rewarded for accomplishing tasks to keep engagement.
